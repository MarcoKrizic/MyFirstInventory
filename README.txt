This program is a basic console application I coded as I was learning C in one of my classes. The program is a bit rough around the edges
as I was learning how pointers in C worked. The program is an "inventory system" of sorts that carries out a few basic functions: You can
enter a new item and its associated quantity into the system where it will be saved until the app is cancelled, search for previously entered
items by entering their associated ID number into a search function, or update the quantity of items available via user input of an ID number and 
an updating function.

Enjoy!
